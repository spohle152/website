        <h1>What is the Purpose?</h1>
        <h2>December 2, 2020</h2>
        <p>I often ask myself what the purpose of what I am doing is. As I had discussed in an earlier post, I have always been focused on saving my time. This is another extension of that. I always wanted to make sure that there was a purpose to whatever I was doing. I wanted something more than just to enjoy doing it. I wanted to feel that what I was doing and what I wanted to do was needed/wanted.

           <br> This evening, I was watching TV when a commercial came on and was talking about being impatient. I could instantly relate as I have always been impatient. You can ask just about anybody I know. Part of it is that I see opportunities to benefit from something come and go. For example, in LiveStreaming, we would live stream many of the basketball games, and we had a new device that would take information from the scoreboard and put it directly into the stream. I thought this was awesome and wanted to use it. Unfortunately, we weren't immediately able to use it because of a cable issue, but I was impatient. I grew more impatient with each passing game, as I realized that there were only so many more games we'd be able to use it for that year. I wanted to see it get the most use as I possibly could. It almost seems as though having more opportunities to use something gives it a more defined purpose and the fewer opportunities to use something gives it less of a purpose. This is part of the reason I like to use as many of the features of the devices I have and part of the reason I do everything for a project I possible can in one session.
            
           <br> While this point of view has made many of the things I do much more professional, it has also led to unnecessary stress. As in the example with live streaming, while I was waiting for the cable to come in, I was overwhelmingly stressed out about it, even though there was absolutely and completely out of my control, just like many things in life. I would not suggest it for that reason. I still look at many things with this point of view and probably will always look at it this way for a the rest of my life. I would suggest it for the level of professionalism that is forces me to strive for, but the stress is a huge drawback to it.
            
           <br> Thanks,
            
           <br> Seth Pohle</p>
