        <h1>Hectic Week</h1>
        <h2>February 12, 2021</h2>
        <p>A lot has happened since the last time that I wrote a blog post. I have redone my website and was able to see what other forms of multimedia I wanted to pursue. I'm not sure how its going to go, but I'm hoping for the best. Over the past moth, I have been able to learn how to do many things. I was able to learn how to manage my time even better than I had before. I still haven't perfected, but I will feel a lot better the closer to perfect it gets. I have been able to focus on Christ and how the only thing that truly matters in life is that I still have God. My grades don't have to be perfect. My blog doesn't have to be updated every day. I don't have to be the smartest person in the room. It is a lesson that has given me a feeling of peace that I never had before. Every time I stress about my life and what is going on in my life, I can pray and I feel a lot better.

           <br> I was also able to learn how to write my first Discord bots. To be honest, it wasn't much of a chore and if I had known how easy it was to create one, I would have created one much sooner. I have coded one bot so far and I plan on coding several more over the next few weeks. If you want to know what bots I code, join my discord using the link below. While you're there, go ahead and subscribe to get blog notifications for when I post a blog and YouTube notifications for when I post a new YouTube video.
            
           <br> I apologize for taking this long to write another blog post. After I wrote the first one, I kept getting busier and busier and never found the time to do it. I am going to try to post blog posts with greater frequency in the future, but it might be a while. When I get busy, I really don't know when I will be able to get another chance to write another blog post. I do hope that it will be sooner in the future. Until next time.
            
           <br> Thanks,
            
           <br> Seth Pohle</p>
