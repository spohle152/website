        <h1>Enjoy the Christmas Season</h1>
        <h2>December 12, 2020</h2>
        <p>Enjoying the Christmas season might seem like one of the easiest things to do but a lot of people feel stressed during this time as they try to help with finding gifts for all their friends. We are stressed about making sure that all the traditions we have are kept. However, we forget that Christmas is a joyous time. As contradictory as this is to what everything you hear around is, Christmas is not a time of giving. It is a time of remembrance the birth of Jesus Christ and a time of preparation for his return. The giving of gifts is something that society has blown out of proportion and have taken all of its meaning away from it. On the night of Christ's birth, we know that the three wise men gave gifts to him. This was to honor him. This is not to say that we shouldn't give other people gifts, especially those less fortunate than us, but we should be doing this all the time. Christmas doesn't change that. I hope that everyone remembers the true meaning of Christmas during this season, not what society has tried to transform it into.

           <br> Thanks and Merry Christmas,
            
           <br> Seth Pohle</p>
