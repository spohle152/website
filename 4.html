        <h1>What's New? Happy Thanksgiving</h1>
        <h2>November 26, 2020</h2>
        <p>It has been a while since my last blog post and I wanted to provide a little more information. I have created a discord server that is open to the public. In that server, there is an option to join a text channel to notify you when there is a new blog post being posted on the website, or if I post a YouTube video. There is also a place for people on the server to chat (after they have accepted the rules). I really think that it is worth checking out.

           <br> Today is also Thanksgiving and I think it would be rude and unfair for me not to point out that we have so much to be thankful for. Going through the hardships of this year, it can be hard to be thankful for anything that has happened this past year. We have many of our activities cancelled due to the pandemic. This is probably the thing that stand out the most to me. However, from being quarantined, I was able to see further how much America was divided and how they would divide over any issue they could find. I also was able to spend more time with my family before I want to college (which I am extremely thankful for), and was able to get used to college with fewer people. The latter is important to me because going to a college with such a larger student base as Purdue from a high school with such a small student base as Jac-Cen-Del would have been a shock had I not eased into it the way that I did. When I first went to Purdue, I participated in an Early Start program and I highly recommend it. It allowed me to be on campus 6 weeks with only about 500 people on campus. This program allowed me to ease into it. I am thankful I was given this opportunity.
            
           <br> These are not the only things that I am thankful for, but this is a majority of them. Through this holiday and as we start to turn our eyes to toward our Christmas celebrations, I urge you to please try really hard to find the things that you are thankful for.
            
           <br> Thanks,
            
           <br> Seth Pohle</p>
