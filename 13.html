        <h1>Where Does the Time Go?</h1>
        <h2>February 19, 2021</h2>
        <p>As the weeks go by, I seem to find myself asking where the time went. How did I lose all this time. Time just seems to continually fly by and all that I can do is make sure that everything I do is worthwhile, because if it isn't, I'm going to be hating myself later. This isn't easy though. I find myself continually procrastinating and not getting the things done. I am tempted to do stuff that isn't productive, then when I cut getting an assignment turned in really close, I hate myself for it. It seems like just yesterday, I was back home helping with stuff at my high school and now I'm already starting to take midterm exams because we are nearing the halfway mark of the semester. Every time I look back, I am shocked by the amount of time that has went by and the amount of work that I got done. I am happy to have gotten as much work done as I have in the past, but I seem to be asking myself "What if?" more often. MY senior year of high school this became my mantra. I didn't want to be able to ask myself "What If?" I wanted to know. I used this most often to motivate me to work. But when COVID hit, this all fell apart. I found myself procrastinating a lot more and putting things off until they were due. I was still able to get them all done, but I really miss my work ethic from before COVID. I'm trying to work it back into my schedule, but it isn't easy. I am still having to continually remind myself that I'll be asking myself "What if had got this done instead of watching TV and YouTube." It really helps motivate me to get more stuff done. While I am getting better, I am still not getting things done with the motivation that I wish I had, but I am starting to feel better about myself and in my abilities.

           <br> Thanks,
