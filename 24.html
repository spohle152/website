        <h1>Its a Small World</h1>
        <h2>March 14, 2022</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, happy Pi Day. Today marks the first day of Purdue's Spring Break. This allows me to be able to write this. It has been a ling time since I have been able to write a blog post because of how busy I have been with my classes. Everyone has examples of times when people they knew knows someone else that you know from a completely different place. There have been a lot of times when this has happened to me. I had one of those moments this week, so I thought I would talk about it for a short time. These types of coinsidences make the entire world feel significantly smaller. The most important part isn't the world feeling small, but just that we know we have our own small corner of it where we have people we can rely on. When I say this, I don't just mean virtually connected, but close in proximity and mentality. While being connected virtually is nice, it can't replace the physical connection between being close to each other. This isn't possible with everyone because not everyone is able to live close enough to each other to be close to someone. Being close to someone is that best thing a person can have. This is something that I have sacrificed while I was in college. I have always been an introvert of sorts, never going out of my way to find someone to talk to. I'm not really sure why I haven't. I think it has to do with I'm scared of differences we might have. I'm lucky for the friends I do have, but I haven't really even tried to make friends in college. The friends I have in college are the same people I was friends with in high school. Friends can make the world a much more plesant place to live. Humans have always been a social species. I tend to believe this is by design. I think that God made us social creatures to make it easier for his people to spead his word. Being able to have a person you can talk to consistantly also helps a person's mental health. This is something that our virtual world has helped out with tremendously. People are now able to quickly text each other and confide in each other. Having someone who cares about what you have to say and being interested in what they have to say is something that is truely special. If both of these people are people of faith, then it can help you grow in faith by talking about religious principles and gaining other perspectives and learning more about the Bible. (Again, I think this was by design.) I would like to say that everyone who find a friend who they can talk to on a daily basis who actually wants to have a conversation everyday, but this is impossible. I know I can't find someone like that very easily. It takes time, but hopefully you'll be able to find someone.

Best of luck,<br>
