        <h1>Anyway Out?</h1>
        <h2>January 22, 2022</h2>
        <p>I would like to start off by saying that I hope everyone reading this had a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I have seen many posts saying it feels like a bad year already. 2022 is pronunced 2020-too. I'm really hoping that is doesn't mean this year is going to be the same as 2020. With panic about the Omicron variant of COVID-19 running rampid, its not looking too bright so far. However, I tend to take a more optimistic look to the year and even how the year has started. First of all, I am feeling better about how I am handling my life situations than I have been for almost 2 years. Second of all, while COVID cases are still rising, we know a lot more about the virus than we did in 2020, we have a vaccine to allow people to protect themselves (even if it doesn't prevent transmission or contraction of the virus) and the variants seem to be getting, while more contagious, less severe, meaning that the virus starting to become something that we won't have to worry about, hopefully. I just finished looking at a video I had a great time making, but was very bittersweet for me. It was a video I had to make much earlier than I had anticipated. It was a video essentially saying goodbye to high school and to a lot of my friends. Of course, most of my closest friends I still got to see following high school, but a lot of my friends I still miss to this day. Friends I often forget about now. It feels like yesterday I was walking up and down the halls at Jac-Cen-Del proud of my accomplishments and confident in my abilities to accomplish anything I set my mind to, but now its been almost two years. When that spring break came in 2020, I was not thinking, this is the last time I'm going to get to see my friends or go to class. I wasn't thinking, this is the last time I'm going to enter or exit this school as a student. Nothing of the sort was going through my mind. Sure it felt weird, but I fully expected things to get back to normal in plenty of time for me to finish out my senior year like a normal high schooler. I wouldn't even be able to have a normal graduation. On March 30, 2020, I made a video containing my most meaningful memories from my time at Jac-Cen-Del. At the time, I wasn't sure if I'd ever get to see most of my friends all in one place again. I realized that we weren't going to be able to go back to school. I realized my last track season had been stripped from me. And I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to have a graduation at all. Thankfully I was able to have a graduation, but it was anything but normal. A lot of people would say I had a hard time giving up high school, and their absolutely right. I enjoyed almost everything I did through high school, whether it was for Jac-Cen-Del, Church, or other thing, I enjoyed it. I have came back several times to help and to relive some of the memories to some degree. I've went back to the Church numberous times and have helped with the media there. I have came back to Jac-Cen-Del and helped with the livestream crew as well as working in the tech office. However, all of this has changed without me. I've had to adjust and I must admit, I miss the way it used to be a lot. I miss the people on my past Rube Goldberg teams. I miss the people on the live stream crew with me. I miss some of the people that used to work media with me. There are a lot of people and things that I miss. However, these things were forever gone in the matter of two weeks in March of 2020. I'm content with that. I know my troubles due to the virus are small compared to many people's. I had parents who were able to work from home. I am still able to afford to go to college and many other things. I have almost everything I could ever wish for. I just feel as though there is something missing. That spring break 2 years ago changed my life and its had me on what feels like an endless roller coaster ever sense. Does anyone know any way out?</p>
