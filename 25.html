        <h1>May the 4th Be With You</h1>
        <h2>May 4, 2022</h2>
        <p>I have never been very big on Star Wars, or Star Trek, or movies or series like them. I haven't even really ever been into Marvel or superhero movies. I've seen a couple, but it hasn't even been anywhere near the most interesting thing I've ever seen. (So in other words, I'm about the most boring person on the face of the planet.) I hadn't even realized it was the Star Wars holiday until I heard one of the Starship robots that operate around campus saying it as I walked past as someone was taking their order from it. I'm so boring that I even enjoy coding different things, so I'm ready to announce my first summer project. Normally, I don't announce my summer projects on my website, but this project directly affects this website. I'm going to be working on completely revamping my website by straying away from the Google Sites editor and entirely code my own website. I know I can do it and I feel I am up to the challenge. I plan to add a more intuitive web design to the website, as well as make better links for reposting blogs posts to social media as well as expending what all I do with the website. I'm not sure what all I want to put on it yet, but if you have any ideas, send them to me. I am not sure exactly how long it will take me to complete this, but I plan to set aside quite a bit of my time off (before my summer job) to it. Once my summer job starts, I will have to work around it. I am also planning on making my own Android and Apple iOS apps that will be able to allow the user to read all blog posts on their phone just like they would if they were reading it one the website. I know that this website is very small and definitely doesn't need phone apps, but I'm not doing it out of necessity, but rather out of the pure enjoyment of making something like this. So be expecting many changes this summer between the website and the possible launch of some phone apps for iOS and Android. And with a transition that Ted Baxter would be proud of: On the lighter side of the news, there is a Supreme Court draft opinion leak that has came out dealing with abortion. This is something that I feel very passionate about. I feel that it is the single most important moral issue in the United States today. Some argue that it is a political issue, but this issue transcends all politics and therefore there are people that are pro-choice and people that are pro-life on both sides of the isle. Feeling as passionately as I do about this issue, I have looked at different arguments for and against abortion. For example, some will claim that the baby is not actually a baby at all. This attempt to dehumanize the baby which by itself is disgusting and shouldn't be tolerated. Not to mention, it is reminiscent of Hitler and other dictators. I would argue that it is in-fact worse that these dictators because the people these dictators would dehumanize had more ability to defend themselves, albeit a small ability. Let's look at the argument for clarity's sake though. To determine if it is a human life, there are two criteria that have to be met. Is it alive and is it a separate human from the mother. The first is fairly easy to prove. The baby is growing and taking nutrients. It also had DNA and cells, which are the building blocks of life. So yes the baby is alive. The next question is actually surprisingly easier to prove. If the baby is not human, then what is it. Two humans cannot conceive a donkey for example. The DNA that is created at conception is unique from the baby's father and mother and therefore it is a separate human life. The only logical place to place the beginning of life is at conception. Being Christian, I also believe that God helps guide the process of conception. I believe that every person is created uniquely and that every characteristic of a person is decided by God. Now we know that this is a human life, because it becomes a human life immediately after conception. This would make any argument that requires dehumanizing the baby useless. Another argument, that I would say is completely invalidated by the proof presented in the previous argument is that mothers would not be able to care for these children. This is simply not true. There are four other options that women can choose that doesn't include abortion. They could practice abstinence and abstain from having sexual relations with anyone unless they are wanting to have a child. This is the one that is the most effective. I would say that a person should not have sex unless they are both married to the person they are having sex with and they realize the risks and are attempting to have a child. I understand that a lot of people disagree with me on that so there are three other options. The second option is to use contraception. This is not 100% effective, but it would be a lot better than nothing. The third is motherhood, or actually taking care of the child. This one is hard for a lot of people to do because of the massive cost that it takes. The fourth is putting the child up for adoption. This one almost always comes with the rebuttal that the number of children up for adoption is already too high as it is. This is not true entirely. According to Adoption Network, there are between one and two million couples waiting to adopt a child. Yet only four percent of unwanted pregnancies are put up for adoption. Adoption is a great option for someone who is pregnant and feels like they are unable to support the child. Another argument for abortion is that since the baby doesn't meet certain criteria, then it doesn't deserve the same rights as anyone else. This always backfires when applied to people outside the womb. They claim that since it is dependent on the mother, then it doesn't deserve to live. Well if this is true, then killing children before they are able to walk, talk, and feed themselves would be okay, which we know it isn't. The same would be true of those who are elderly and require a caretaker. This argument is immoral and completely ignores its own consequences. People also claim that the baby isn't able to feel anything before it is in the womb. Well, this isn't actually true as studies have proven that the baby is able to feel pain after 7 to 8 weeks at the latest. Not to mention, that would make it okay to kill someone who is unable to feel pain. This wouldn't make sense outside of the womb either. Then they make the criteria to be conscious. Well if this is the argument, then what about those who are on their deathbed in coma, or are just sleeping. Is it okay to kill them? Of course not. It is not possible to come up with a way to defend the killing of babies for mere convenience. The birth canal does not grant a baby special rights. Those rights should be protected inside or outside the womb. Roe v Wade claimed that the right to an abortion was guaranteed under privacy. Abortion has nothing to do with privacy. No where in the Constitution does it say that all women have the right to kill their babies if they want to. It doesn't say anything remotely similar to that. Therefore, the courts should overturn Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey, another Supreme Court case based on Roe v Wade, and give the right to the states to make abortion laws as they see fit. I think abortion should be outlawed in all states as I think it is worse than slavery in many respects, but I realize this probably won't happen in my lifetime as states like California and New York will keep their pro-life policies for a long time to come.</p>
