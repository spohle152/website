        <h1>College Starts Back Up</h1>
        <h2>January 18, 2021</h2>
        <p>With this being the first post of 2021, I hope you have had a great first part of your year. I hope it went as well as mine did. Today was the day I moved back into my dorm at Purdue. While I enjoyed my time at home, I was starting to want to come back to Purdue, although I wasn't really looking forward to classes starting again. I remember my time this past Christmas fondly and am glad that I got to spend that time with my family and I can't wait until I can spend more time with my family. As I sure anyone who knows much of anything about me knows, I am a stickler for routines, so I like stuff to remain constant so that I don't have to change my routine. Purdue has definitely made me redo my routine and I can't say its a bad thing, but it has been something I'm not a big fan of. As the semester goes along, I'll be able to get used to my routine again and I'll start to feel better about it, just like last semester. Dealing with change will always required the modification of routines, but change is inevitable and modifications to routines will always have to change. A plan is not set in stone and so a plan has to be malleable enough to be modified when changes occur.</p>
