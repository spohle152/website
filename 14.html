        <h1>Finding the Time To Still Do the Things that I want to do</h1>
        <h2>February 21, 2021</h2>
        <p>I have had a lot of busy weeks. My entire last semester was busier than I ever thought I would have had. This semester I thought would be different because the classes that I was taking were a lot more within my interest field and I was taking fewer credit hours. I was right. The first few weeks, I had so much free time, I didn't know what to do with all the time I had. I got used to a schedule where I wasn't doing very much. This was not a good thing though, I started getting busier and busier as the week went on. As can be seen from my other posts, I wasn't able to work with it very well. I didn't want to work again. I have finally gotten used to my new work load and I'm really happy that I did. I feel much more accomplished now that I have all the things I wanted to get done done. Getting things done is something that feels good to do, but it something that is really hard to do. Making a schedule and having a plan makes it a lot easier, but that schedule and plan needs to be flexible enough to change when there is a change in different parts of the schedule. Otherwise it will fail. Be careful. Remember that your mental health is more important that your classes. Don't let classes dictate your happiness. However, make sure that you aren't neglecting your classes and you will feel a lot better. 

           <br> Thanks,
            
           <br> Seth Pohle
