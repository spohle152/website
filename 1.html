        <h1>First Blog Post</h1>
        <h2>November 15, 2020</h2>
        <p>Hello. My name is Seth Pohle and I am a Jac-Cen-Del 2020 Graduate and have made the decision to study Electrical Engineering at Purdue University. I plan on using this blog to help me express my thoughts about what is going on in my life (as well as to spend my free time more productively). 

           <br> The most important thing in my life is my belief in Jesus Christ. I am a member of the First Baptist Church of Aurora. I strive to follow Jesus in everything that I do. I am going to use this blog to help express my feelings about religion along with many other tings in my life.
       
           <br> Throughout my years in high school, I have the privilege of participating in many extra-curricular activities such as Rube Goldberg, Drama Club, Live Streaming, and many more. You can see a more complete list in the video on my YouTube channel (linked on the homepage) named "High School Memories"
       
           <br> I don't post on my YouTube channel too much, but I will occasionally post a video update. I will probably post here pretty much randomly. Whenever there is something that I want to talk about, I will probably post that here.
       
          <br> The main goal of this post is to let those reading my posts know a little more about me. I hope to post more and I hope you enjoy reading what I have to say.
       
      <br> Thanks,
       
      <br> Seth Pohle</p>
