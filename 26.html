        <h1>Important Scriptures and Follow-up on Abortion</h1>
        <h2>July 9, 2022</h2>
        <p>I have placed a lot of weight for my spiritual life behind 3 scriptures. The first one is John 3:16-17. This scripture says that “God so loved the world that he sent his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but to save it through him.” It is generally accepted that this is one of the most important parts of the Bible. This lays out the hope for the Christian who believes in God. This don’t simply mean believing that God exists. The people who truly believe in God have a great desire to share Christ with those around them and to read their Bible and pray so that they can better know what God wants them to do. The people should also have a desire to stop sinning, although they will still sin. This leads me into my second scripture, Romans 3:23. In this scripture, the Bible says, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” This scripture reinforces the fact that the only one to live a sinless life was Jesus Christ. That is why he was able to die on the cross to forgive us our sins. He was able to defeat death. Through his ultimate sacrifice, we can make it to heaven if we accept his forgiveness. That is why Jesus says in John 14:6 “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”
            <br><br>Over the past couple of weeks, I have seen a lot of people posting about the overturning of Roe v. Wade and since I had recently made a blog post about it, I decided to follow-up on it. First and foremost, the overturning of Roe v. Wade doesn’t make abortion illegal in every state. It only makes it so that the states can outlaw abortion if they see fit. Now furthermore, I still think abortion in any form is wrong and I am about to explain why. I have heard the argument in support of abortion only if the mother is in danger. This argument has one fatal flaw. You must either value the unborn life, or you don’t. The mother being in danger doesn’t change the fact that the unborn life has immense value. I don’t think that the mother should be forced to die because of a problematic pregnancy. I would like to make it clear; this is a very rare occurrence. I believe that the doctor should attempt to save both the mother and the child. If this means added risk to the mother, the mother should have known the risks of having a child and consented to those risks before having sex, even if it was an unwanted pregnancy. The child did not consent to this risk, so why should the baby be automatically killed to save the mother. This does not seem like a moral conclusion to me. Therefore, I am still against abortion, even in cases where the pregnancy is a risk to the mother.
            <br><br>Another argument that I have seen was something along the lines of, men don’t have a say in the abortion argument. Last time I checked, it took a man and a woman together to be able to make a child, so the man is intimately involved with the issue at hand. Also, this is a moral issue and a significant moral issue at that. And the last time that I checked women are not the only ones to have moral compasses. Of course, I think that women should be allowed to express their opinions on the issue, but there is no reason to exclude any group for any reason.
            <br><br>The last thing I want to touch on with this debate s going back to the Roe v. Wade overturn. I keep hearing the words “the constitutional right to an abortion.” The law on this has been shaky from the moment it was introduced. Many pro-choice and pro-life law experts from across the country have found the ruling behind Roe v. Wade to be flawed, to say the least. From the time it was released, many people had claimed that abortion was not a constitutional right. The overturning of Roe v. Wade just made it so that what many of the law experts had been saying was recognized by the Supreme Court and would therefore be changed across the country accordingly.\
            <br><br>Now I want to go back to the passages talked about at the beginning of the blog post. With these scriptures, we know that a person must accept Christ’s forgiveness. This means turning their life over to God for his control. But we all make mistakes. The Bible reminds us of that in Romans. We are born with a sinful nature. There is nothing you can do where you’re too far from God that you’re not able to find your way back. I truly believe this. That doesn’t mean its going to be easy to make your way back to Jesus, but it does mean that there is hope. I still believe that those who have had abortions are still not too far from God to be right with God. God sees your sin and no matter how big or how small it is, he is willing and able to forgive you your sin. In God’s eyes, it doesn’t matter if you murdered someone, had an abortion, or just used a curse word in casual conversation, it is sin in his eyes. He is willing to forgive you, as long as you are willing to give your life to him.
            <br><br>I apologize for this blog post being all over the place. I hope that you were able to follow along.
            <br>Thanks,
            <br>Seth Pohle
