        <h1>It's Been an Even Longer While [Thank You]</h1>
        <h2>August 31, 2021</h2>
        <p>There have been many famous people who have done great things. I am not one of those people, nor do I want to become one of those people. I can't say I've never had the desire to be famous, but I wouldn't exactly call that recent. Seeing what fame makes people do to their friends scares me. I've realized how much my friends mean to me. I wouldn't change the way my life is arranged for anything. I have a girlfriend who is better for me than I could've ever imagined. I have parents who have love me unconditionally and a brother who is more than a friend to me and someone who has changed my life for the better. My entire family has been supportive of everything I've tried to do. I am very blessed to have the people in my life that I do and I wouldn't trade them for anything or change their roles. God has been very good to me. I do believe that God put all of these people into my life to teach me something and shape me. Each of the people I mentioned and many more have shaped my life in tremendous ways. Many of them probably haven't seen how they have affected my life, but they have made a tremendous impact on my life. For all of you, reading this or not, THANK YOU!!!

         <br>   Thanks,
            
         <br>   Seth Pohle</p>
