        <h1>Popular Opinion</h1>
        <h2>December 18, 2020</h2>
        <p>There is a theory in Psychology that says that what people do is sways by public opinion. No one wants to rock the boat. This is the idea of conformity. As we saw throughout history, when everyone conforms without anything to pull them away from each other, it does not end very well. A specific example of this is the Stanford Prison Experiment. When we conform, it releases anything that might make us realize if something is wrong. With the talk of unity, I think it is important to talk about the difference between unity and conformity.

          <br>  As I said before, conformity is almost never a good thing. Unity can be a good thing as long as long as it doesn't turn into conformity. I think what is really needed is a sense of unity where we don't argue just for the sake of arguing; Refusing to acknowledge something just because we disagree with the end result. We need to find a way to be respectful to the other party. It doesn't mean we need to accept everything that comes our way. Embracing everything that comes up and dismissing any resistance is a way to go to immediate conformity. All I'm going to say is beware of conformity. Seek a form of unity that questions the other side based on logistics, not based off what the other side is saying.
