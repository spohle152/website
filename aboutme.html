        <h1>Thank you for coming to my website!</h1>
        <p>First and foremost, I am a member of the <a href="http://aurorabaptist.org"> First Baptist Church of Aurora, IN. </a> At church I volunteer in many capacities including running the computer for Sunday worship services when I am able to and helping with Operation Christmas Child. I have a very supporting family that includes my mother, father, and brother. My brother is the one and only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCls6MjfxzWBVhRKV1fohOcg"> Pulzer</a>, also known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo2Ya5kIcQ7KMsvMuGAnOJA">Josh Pohle</a>. I am also a college student at Purdue studying to become an electrical engineer. I am a Jac-Cen-Del graduate. During my time at Jac-Cen-Del, I ran Cross Country and Track (800m, 1600m, and 3200m). I also participated in <a href="http://rubegoldberg.com"> Rube Goldberg</a> with the Ripley County Engineering Academy. We placed 2nd place at nationals in 2018 and 3rd at nationals in 2019. We were a qualifying team for nationals in 2020, but because of the pandemic, we were unable to compete. I also was part of the <a href="http://youtube.com/JacCenDelSchools"> Jac-Cen-Del Schools </a>Livestreaming crew where we would livestream the various events at the school. <br> You can contact me at <a href="mailto:sethpohle@sethpohle.com"> sethpohle@sethpohle.com</a>. I appreciate you looking at my blogs and I hope you enjoy them. </p>
