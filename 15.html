        <h1>It's Been A While</h1>
        <h2>April 13, 2021</h2>
        <p>Now that is has been more than a month since my last blog post, I decided to let you all know that I am still here. A lot has changed since my last post. Part of the reason I haven't posted in a while is because I have decided to buckle down on my school work all the more and quit the endless procrastinating that I was plague to during and after COVID. And luckily, it worked! I am happy to say that I feel tremendously better about myself and my studies. It was hard to get started, but once I got started, it all felt natural again. I am still working on getting some aspects of my life back to normal, but I am feeling much better than I was. Every once in a while, I will get annoyed at myself and go on a rant to my family or friends about how stuff isn't going the way I wanted it to, but I have come once again to the realization that it isn't in my control. It shouldn't ever be in my control. It never was in my control. If my life would've been in my control, I wouldn't have met the friends that I did. I wouldn't have taken the opportunities that I did. I would be walking around aimlessly without a clue what I was doing with my life. Sure, I want to become an Electrical Engineer and the schooling that I'm getting at Purdue helps to reinforce that, but that's not the purpose of my life. Sure, I want to make and keep friends with the same or similar beliefs as mine, but if I had none, that wouldn't be the purpose of my life. I have a purpose for my life. You have a purpose for your life as well. It goes deeper than the job you plan to get. It goes deeper than all the actions that you make. It goes deeper than the friends you make. The job you get, the friends you make, the actions make all have an underlying purpose. I believe it is to either spread the word of God or to receive it. As I have went through my teen years, I've noticed it even more, especially in college. Everyday, I try my best to stand against the world and its beliefs.
